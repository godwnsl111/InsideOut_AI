{"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) Well, we've got a few minutes here this morning just to take stock of your situation with your diabetes now and how you're feeling about it.

How are you feeling at the moment and how are you feeling about your diabetes? "}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm feeling comfortable that my diet's under control fairly well. There are still some improvements to be made, and they're coming. I'm not exercising as much as I should."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Right"}, {"role": "user", "content": "And I'm finding every excuse in the world to not go take a walk."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) So you know what you should be doing, but it's not so easy to do it.

What I want to do is first of all just lay out for the two of us what we could be talking about today, OK, and then we'll make a decision. First of all, we could talk about your test result, which I've got the result for. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "OK"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) The A1C. We could talk about your diet. We could talk about your exercise, and I know that you're not a drinker and you're not a smoker, or we could talk about anything else that you'd like to. Have you got a sense, if you think about those things, which of them you'd most like to talk about? What would you find helpful?

I do feel it's important that I do more exercising. I know it's in my own best interest, and yet I don't do it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) And so there's something that's stopping you.

So the thought of taking exercise is just not a pleasant one for you. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "No it's not"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Yeah? Is that what you're saying? "}, {"role": "user", "content": "That's exactly what I'm saying."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(CR) Yeah.

"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I have thought about other things to do. I've thought of, 'Geez, go play a game,' and there don't seem to be any that appeal to me. I don't know. I'm not finding anything pleasant about that chore."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(CR) And so that must be quite frustrating for you, knowing.. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "It is. It is. It really is frustrating, and I wish I would just get beyond it and go get the exercise done. I could have a higher quality of life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) In what way? How would this improve your life? How do you see that? "}, {"role": "user", "content": "I would have more energy. I'd have less weight to carry around with me all the time. The A1C would come down."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Right "}, {"role": "user", "content": "I get a sense that I could eat more starches if I was burning them off with exercise."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Right. So you can see the link there between the intake of food and the exercise that you'd have. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Yeah. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "I've actually had insomnia for years. I understand I would sleep better if I would go get the exercise."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Right "}, {"role": "user", "content": "And yet at the moment, when it's time to go take the walk, I don't think of those things. It's 'Oh, what a burden it is to go take a walk' either in my neighborhood or somewhere else."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) So you can see all these good reasons why it would be a good idea, but you hit a barrier, and what you'd really like to do is to try and break through that barrier somehow. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "That's exactly where I'm at."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) Yeah. And I wonder what you think might be just the first small step that could help you through that barrier.  Do you see what I'm saying? Because sometimes people think about exercise and it becomes a bigger and bigger and bigger thing in their minds, and then actually the barrier gets bigger, and I'm wondering if there is some way we can just lower the barrier for you , so that there's a small step you could take. I'm not sure what it is. (PERSUADE WITH)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe that's the problem. Maybe I'm not seeing any way through."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) Yeah "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Other than, I think it's how I think about it. If I would quit seeing it as such a huge burden, it wouldn't be such a huge burden. Is that it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Well, it certainly sounds like it for you, that if you could not be saying those things to yourself, the barrier would feel a bit better. It's what makes sense to you that matters here. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "OK. Is it something to the effect of I hear myself thinking, 'This is such a horrible chore,' and then I go, 'Oh. Find another way to think about this.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Yep. It sounds like that's quite a trap for you in a way, isn't it, the way you think about it.  And can you think of a way, a more positive way of looking at it that will take you out of that trap? What could you say to yourself? "}, {"role": "user", "content": "I could tell myself, 'It's not nearly that big of a deal.' Maybe I could just tell myself, 'Instead of sitting here thinking about it, why don't you go take the walk and get it done and over with?'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) And what would that walk be like for you? Can you think of a manageable walk that you could immediately go and do? "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes. Most of this happens at home."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Yes"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I could simply go outside and take the walk. Now, I don't like walking in windstorms. I don't want to be out in the rain. "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Exactly "}, {"role": "user", "content": "At that point I can, maybe I can go somewhere indoors that has a walking track, and I don't really know where that is yet."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) Right. So you're thinking that might be a possibility. And you know your A1C level is a little bit raised this morning, and let me just see if I can summarize what we've said today and see what you make of this. OK? Your A1C is a little bit raised. You're aware that it's important to watch your diet. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) You've been trying to do something about that. But of all the subjects we could talk about, it's exercise where you feel you could make the most progress "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) And you're aware of the benefits of that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) For your health, for sleeping, and just for feeling better about yourself generally. You're aware of that. It's breaking through a barrier in which your negative thinking is translated into something that's more positive, and you do some form of manageable exercise. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) We haven't quite worked out what it is yet. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right, exactly."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) OK. OK. So you've more or less decided you want to do it, but you're just not quite sure what it is yet. Have I got you? (CR, Q)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes. You've got it perfect."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) Is there anything else about your diabetes that you'd like to talk about? Anything at all. We've got just a couple of minutes left. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "You know what. I would like some more recipes for things like chicken and fish, and I think that the local county extension agent has some of those, and so I think it would just take a phone call of finding out how to get those."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Yeah. So you've got your eye on some things you can do by way of cooking that you know are going to make a difference if you can just get hold of the recipes. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes. And that's just a matter of making a phone call, and they've got some way of distributing some diabetic recipes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(AF) Right. Brilliant! And you're going to do that. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(AF) That's excellent. Yeah, that's very good. You know, my impression, just before we say goodbye this morning, because I will be seeing you again, my impression is that you've really made quite an effort since you've [been] diagnosed to get on top of the different things you need to look after yourself. And I wouldn't be too discouraged about the exercise. I think, it feels to me like you're on the cusp, you're on the cusp of making a breakthrough there, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if you come back next time and you have broken through that barrier. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, that would be so delightful. I really would like to get through this one."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(AF) Yeah. Excellent. All right, well look, I'll get your appointment to see the eye doctor sorted out for you, OK, and I'll check that your feet are properly seen to. I'll be speaking to the nurse when you leave the room, and I'll see you soon. "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) OK "}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) So Fred, I'm wondering if you can tell me a little about what brings you here today to the parenting center. I have a report from the social worker saying that you have been referred for a parenting skills class, but I don't know much more about it than that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. I got upset and I blew up at the social worker. She called me and told me that the teacher reported a mark on Mikie, and so I got upset, and it wasn't so much that she called about the mark. It was about the way she was speaking to me that really got me upset."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Mm hmm"}, {"role": "user", "content": "She made me feel as though maybe I wasn't being a good father."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Ah."}, {"role": "user", "content": "'Cause I'm trying to be a better father, and she made me feel as though I was abusive to Mike."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(CR) Hmm. The interaction you had with her - you ended up with a feeling like she thought you were an abusive father, and particularly she wasn't picking up on the fact that you've made a lot of efforts to be a good Dad."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Well, I understand that she wouldn't know, because I don't know her, she doesn't know me, but then I felt maybe she was just assuming, you know, from one mark that there was a history of abuse, and I really don't. I mean, my father hit me, and I'm trying my best not to be so physically abusive with - or not so much 'abusive,' but physical with my son."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) You feel like you've already been making efforts to change the way you're disciplining your child."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, I have. That's one of the most important things to me as a father, because I don't assume that the way I was raised was right. I know there were some things about it that were good, but for the most part I feel that there are things that I could improve upon and I've been working hard to improve these things, or maybe, in my opinion, I've been working hard."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) Can you tell me a little bit more about that? Like how would you like to change the way you are with your child?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'd like to be more patient."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) I see."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, more patient. I don't want to say 'understanding,' because I do try to see - even though he's a child, I still try to see things from his point of view."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Mm hmm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which is very difficult, but I don't want him to grow up disrespectful, and I don't want him to grow up and come across as weak to other people."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) OK"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) On the one hand, you want to improve the way you are with him, and you don't want to be so physical in your punishment, but on the other hand you don't want him to be weak, and you don't want him to be disrespectful."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, I feel it's important for him to understand the role of authority."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Uh huh"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Especially within the family. Yes, because it is my house. I consider it my house, and as my kid, I don't necessarily want him to be obedient, but I want him to be conscious of the decision-maker."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Mm hmm. You would like some respect from your son."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, definitely"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) And on the other hand, it doesn't seem like the way things have been going is getting you what you want."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, sadly I do feel that way. I do feel that way. I feel that as I've tried to show authority, I guess, with the physical, I don't think it's helping, because I think, well, I've been noticing that Mike's becoming gradually, or I don't know gradually, but I've noticed that he's been more afraid of me lately, and when I do raise my voice he becomes withdrawn, and when I become angry with him, he starts to cry a little. So I suppose in trying to make him stronger and not cry, so to speak, I believe maybe I'm kind of getting the outcome I'm trying to avoid."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(CR) Huh. So even though you're trying to have a child that's respectful and strong, and not weak, what's happening is the exact reverse, that he's becoming afraid of you and kind of intimidated by you, and you don't like that."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Oh, not at all, because that's how I was raised, and I didn't... I guess my reaction wasn't to cry, so I assumed Mike that would be the same. I mean, they don't have a manual on parenting."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Yeah. Well, isn't that right. Nobody gives you a manual and tells you how to do it right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) And you came out OK from the parenting you got from your Dad, and you were thinking that it would turn out OK for Mikie, but as you're looking at the way things are going, you're saying, 'You know what, I think I need more.'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. I definitely need more. I think, well I'm noticing now that Mike and I are two - well, as much as we are alike, we are very different in many ways, and so maybe what worked for me is not going to work for Mike."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Yeah. And that maybe he needs different things for discipline that you'd like to know more about."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Yeah, definitely."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) Well, what thoughts have you had about different ways that you might discipline your child, and still, you know, still have the kind of respect that you feel like you're gonna need?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, I think - well, my wife practices this choice thing that I don't really understand too well, so I want to learn a little more about how to give Mike choices, and also I'm thinking maybe like stars on the fridge, some sort of incentive type program."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) I see. So you've heard about some ways of doing things with Mikie that your wife is doing, and you're thinking, 'You know what, I could learn some of those things and maybe just try them out.'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. I mean these things are completely new to me. I really don't understand them, so I definitely want to learn them. Definitely."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Q) And I wonder what you think about coming to a place like this, where that's kind of our job, is to teach people different ideas or different ways of becoming a parent."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, but - I don't know. I'm not too sure about certain things. I would prefer if I spoke more with like a group of men. If there was something like that. I don't feel a woman can really teach me how to be a Dad, because being a Dad is a male thing, so..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) You want to be in a place where people can respect what it's like to be a father, and the kind of contribution a Dad makes that might be different maybe than the contribution a Mom makes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes. I mean, no offense, but a man understands a man better than a woman would, so, yeah, especially if maybe they were other Dads in my similar situation, we can talk about things, maybe iron it out together, and understand it a little bit more thoroughly as a group."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) So one thing that would make it easier to come to a place like this is if you felt that it wasn't all about the way women do things with children."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) And that there was something more about the way specifically Dads do things with children."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes. Yes, I think women and men do things very differently, and think it makes a balance, and especially for a son, they need that balance. So I want Mike to have the male perspective."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Yep. You don't want to lose that in everything that's going on here."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Not at all."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) And that's important to you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) And it's also important to you to learn some ways of doing things that won't make your child afraid of you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, well, yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Even though you want your son to have the input of a father, you don't want your son to be afraid."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, I don't want to teach him how to do that to his son, so maybe I can stop it here? Yeah. I think it's important to - that any improvements, if I want improvements, the improvements have to start with me, and so I want to try not to strike Mike any more. I know it's going to be tough, cause it's in a moment of passion and everything, but I feel that I can do it. I can do it, with the help."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(AF) I think you can do it too, and I think that you really have taken a step towards becoming a better parent, and you've just made up your mind that this is something you're going to do. I can see it, right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(PERSUADE WITH) And I do think we have some classes here that might be helpful for you, and that would also, I think, take care of this thing with the social worker, right, and kind of take care of that and get that off your back. And we do have classes where there are fathers. Now, the classes are run by both a man and a woman, so it's not just a woman and it's not just a man, it's both of them together running the classes. And there are both men and women in there, because both men and women sometimes need to learn or want to learn different ways of, you know, disciplining their children. So it's not just one or the other, and so I wonder how that would feel to you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I, well, I feel , well, I obviously have to do it, but I feel like the women being there would kind of like - I really wouldn't want to say anything cause I don't like arguing with women, so I'll give it a shot, but I'm really not too enthusiastic about the women being there."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Um hmm. That's a little bit not what you wanted."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. It's actually a lot not what I wanted."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) But you might be willing to give it a try."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Oh yeah.

That's what I mean by 'here.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) So for you to come here really means that you're going to have to pay attention to the reaction people have about your authority and whether you're still going to get the respect that you feel you deserve."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, I feel like it may kind of diminish my image a little"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Uh huh"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, so I kind of keep it a secret. I'm really not telling anybody. I'm not broadcasting that, 'Hey, I'm taking these, uh, sessions, but it's not .."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(EMPHASIZE) And of course that's your choice, whether you would tell people about coming here. That really is entirely up to you, but I'm struck by how you really are willing to pay a big price in order to do something that's right for your boy."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Parenting's not easy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) No, that's right."}]}

And I don't know where she's getting all this from, this is really...."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What does she say to you about her concerns?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well she says she's afraid that you know I'll do something to hurt the kids.

Up until my wife moved out things were going pretty good. We're not divorced but my wife is kind of upset at me also. She moved out a couple of three months ago."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Do you kind of have the feeling that your wife and daughter are ganging up against you?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "It feels that way. I don't know if that true, but I just kind of feel like-- what do They call it? 'Once they get you down everyone jumps on'. That's the way I feel now. Since that DWI thing, car wreck and everything, my wife's left , my daughters you know raising cane with me. Now my probation officer wanting to eat my lunch, put me in jail, you know, break me financially and things. My boss has all but said if I lose my driver's license I won't have a job there. I've got about 3 more years to go before I retire. So a lot of what I'm doing here or you know why I'm coming here.. the only reason I'm coming here is so I can maybe save my driver's license so I won't lose my job and so I won't lose my house. It's not because I want to do any of this crap you know."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) Yeah. You're not here because you think you have a problem.

The court sent me here."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) And that's the only reason you're here."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah I'll be honest with you. There's no need in me lying to you because you know unless you go down and tell the court that you know I'm not motivated to be here or anything, but I don't like any of this I'll be honest with you. It's taking a lot of time that I don't have. Its taking of money I don't have for the court and the fines and all this stuff. On top of that I've got to pay my lawyer $1000 which I don't have to represent me and I guess he's probably one of the reasons I'm here today because... but you know he and I drink together? I've known this guy ever since he got out of law school. He's a good friend of mine, but I said 'Now, why do I have to go up there you know I'm paying you $1000 to represent me and I've got to go over and go through this evaluation and all that.' That does not make sense. And he says, 'You've got a drinking problem.' Hell, you know I've had to take him home a lot of times, that I've been the one standing and he been passed out and couldn't walk. It doesn't make sense. None of this makes sense."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SR) So it's confusing to you why your drinking should cause a problem or everybody should be talking about that when you look around and you see that other people drink more than you do."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well at this point it my life- it'd be different now- I mean, 10 years ago I probably would have taken my medicine without being too cranky about it.

I used to be a rounder, I used to fight, I used to rodeo, I used to drink a lot, I made a living hauling rodeo stock and everything. Now I've settled down in the last 8-10 years, I've got me a good job. I'm driving short distance hauls. I drink a little bit but I work hard. It's nothing for me to sit down and drink a six-pack or two of beer and still be able to function.

I used to go down and hang out in some pretty rough places. I got throwed in jail a couple of times: Disorderly Conduct , Public Brawling, and things like that.

Well I'd already had 3-4 beers, maybe more, we'd partied that night before and I got up and was feeling bad, so I had 3 or 4 drinks early that morning, But I was just going to the lake, I wasn't going to work. It was my Saturday off and then they called me. And I went ahead and on the way out to the job, settin there at that 4 way stop sign and this old woman, she must have been 100 years old, come flying down the road and crashed right into the back end of that pickup of mine and the police come and damned if they didn't arrest me. And they say it's my fault for being there. Now that didn't make sense. You know...some kids or a school bus been sitting there that woman would have wiped them all out.
